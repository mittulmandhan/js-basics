**Q1. What is the difference between let and var?**
- var and let, both are the keywords use to declare variables but difference between them given below:

var                                                                |let
------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------
var has function scope i.e. within the body of a function          |let has block level scope i.e. within the curly braces({})
The scope of var is confusing for the native C and Java Developers |let has same scope properties as varibles in C and Java
